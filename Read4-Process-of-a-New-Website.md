#What is the process to make a new website? 

##Planning 
1 – Decide who the site is for (Who is the target audience? Individuals or companies)
1 – Indicate the reason(s) people would visit your site.  
    - What are they trying to achieve?
    - What information are they looking for?
    - Frequency of visits?

##Building
1 – Make a site map (similar to an org chart)
1 – Turn it into a wireframe (layout of the actual page)
1 – Decide on a design (color schemes, graphics, fonts)
    - Visual hierarchy: the order in which visitors will view your page. What draws their attention first?
    * Grouping is important here as our brains naturally do this on their own and similarities in design make things more visually pleasing and in turn easier to see/view.
1 – Design the page navigation (keep it clear, concise, simple)

**HTML** - tells the page how it should be structured (Headings, body, paragraph, etc.)
  - Regular HTML uses <div>. HTML5 does not.  
**CSS** - tells the page how to be styled (Colors, fonts/formatting styles, photos, ets.)

##Extras
  * You can add a comment in your code that will not be visible in the browser use: <! - - comment goes here - - >
  * The <meta> tag is not visible to users and tells search engines what your page is, who created it and if it is time specific.
