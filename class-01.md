*Duckett HTML Book*

  - HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language - used to create web pages (text documents)
    - Attributes: opening/closing tag with description of element
    - Structures: head (contains title), body (contains sections such as main and header)

  - HTML5: Still a work in progress, but can still be used to write the code
    - Does not require closing all tags, other attributes still to be introduced
    - HTML5 elements indicate purpose and parts of a webpage and describe structure
  - Add comments inline with <!-- and --> markers
  - ID and class attributes identify certain elements
  - <meta> tag lets you supply information about your web page
  - Escape characters include code written for ampersand, copyright, currency symbols, etc.

  - Site map: plans structure of site
  - Wireframe: sketch or outline to plan the layout/information on the page
  - Size, color and style differentiate pieces of information
  - Grouping and similarities help the page visitor view the information presented

*Duckett JS Book*

  - JavaScript in a browser: 
    - Slideshows
    - Forms
    - Reload part of a page
    - Filtering data

  - Script: series of instructions
    - Write the script: define the goal (task), design the script (split the goal into a series of tasks), code the steps/series of tasks

  - HTML creates the model of the web page, JavaScript makes the page interactive
  - JavaScript can be written within HTML, but should live in it's own file (a .js page)

  - HTML is the bones, CSS is the skin/hair/nails, JavaScript is the muscles
