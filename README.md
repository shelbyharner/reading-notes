## Shelby's Code 102 Reading Notes
- **Explain “growth mindset” in your own words:**
  - A growth mindset to me means that someone is keen on and open to learning, growing and expanding their mind and skillset. A person with this mindset would be interested in finding out and learning new things (ie. skills or information) and would be energized by successfully absorbing and demonstrating their new learnings in a real-life environment. This person would also not be discouraged by obstacles or failures and would view them as challenges that are a positive step to solidifying their learning.


- **Three reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset:**
  - Don't be discouraged by challenges, getting stuck or failures.
  - Awkwardness at the beginning is part of the process. The more practice I have the faster I'll find my groove. 
  - Focus on the feeling of learning and accomplishing. It helps me to feel energized and then be more proactive at my tasks.
