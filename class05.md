# Putting it all together

  - Draw boxes around components and subcomponents and name them
  - Single responsibility principle: a component should only do one thing
  - UI and data models tend to adhere to the same information architecture

  - Build your static site first and then add the logic/features
  - Build top down or bottom up
  - There are two types of "model" data in React: props and state

  - DRY: Don't repeat yourself
  - React likes one-way data flow down the component hierarchy
  - Identify every component that renders something based on state
  - Find a common component owner
  - Less difficult to read modular, explicit code
  - Helps long term with large libraries of components
