# NODE.JS

## An Intro to Node.js
  - What is Node.js: runtime build on Chrome V8 JS engine
  - The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other chromium-based browsers (Brave, Opera, Vivaldi)
  - Responsible for compiling JS directly to native machine code that the computer can execute
  - Best to install Node with a version manager: downloads many versions and lets you switch between them as needed
  - Check node version with "node -v"
  - Node comes with a package manager called npm
  - Check npm version with "npm -v"
  - A folder titled "node_modules" is where npm saves lodash and any libraries associated
  - Node lets us run JS on the server
  - Node causes the server very little overhead so is capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
  - Pair programming is when a two person team codes together as one person being the "driver" or person that types and the other person being the "navigator" the person who verbally directs the coding
  - Pair programming is used for:
    - interative loops
    - code reviews
    - fast feedback
    - error checking and linting
  - It creates greater efficiency by having two sets of eyes on the code to catch mistakes
  - It is more engaging for both coders involved
  - Creates a scenario where coders can learn from eachother more closely/easily
  - Improves social skills
  - Prepares programmers for interviews by practicing carrying out exercises together
  - Prepares programmers for real work environments for the same reasons as well
