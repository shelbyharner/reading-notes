# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding
What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
  - The rise of personal computers in the home happened at the same time that women in computer science started to decline. Personal computers were marketed almost entirely to men/boys.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
  - It gave males a complete leg up on any females trying to break into the industry. For example, females in college would be expected to know the same things as male students even though the likelyhood that they had grown up with a computer in the home and had prior experience was minimal and therefore put the female students at a disadvantage.

## Employee breakdown of key technology companies
What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
  - The tech world is still predominantly white and male.
  - We need more recent data.
  - The US population is by a small margin majority female.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company
When are diversity efforts most successful?
  - They are most successful when they are driven by company leaders. 
Why do diverse companies perform better?
  - Diverse companies perform better because they bring a varied approach to seeing problems and by extension faster, better and more efficient ways of solving those problems.
Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
  - Diversity in a company creates a better experience for their users/customers. For example, some YouTube iOS app features were created by right-handed developers, so left-handed users frequently uploaded videos upside down as a result.
