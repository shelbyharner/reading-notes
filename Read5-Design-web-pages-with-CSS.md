# Read5 Design Web Pages with CSS

CSS allows you to create rules that will specify how the content of the the webpage will look. For example, color, font family and style, layout and navigation. 

## CSS Selectors
    - Universial selector: applies to all elements in the document (ex.* {})
    - Type selector: matches element names (ex. h1, h2, h3)
    - Class selector: matches an element whose class attribute matches the one after the period (ex. .note or p.note)
    - ID selector: matches an element whose attribute matches the value after the pound or hash symbol (ex. #introduction)
    - Child selector: matches an element that is a direct child of another (ex. li>a{})
    - Descendant selector: matches an element that is a descendent of another specified element (not only a direct child) (ex. p a {})
    - Adjacent sibling selector: matches an element that is the next sibling of another (ex. h1+p)
    - General sibling selector:  matches an element that is a sibling of another but it doesn't have to be the directly preceding element (ex. h1~p)
