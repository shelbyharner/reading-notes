#The Coder's Computer Notes

What is a text editor? 
   A text editor is a web based or desktop based piece of software that allows you to write and manage text you put together to create a website. 

Features to look for in a text editor: 
 1. Code completion (allows you to start typing and this feature provides suggestions to auto complete)
 2. Syntax highlighting (displays text, especially source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms)
 3. A good variety of themes. (reduces eye strain and fatigue - dark mode or rainbow text)
 4. A good variety of extensions to choose from if/when you need them.
