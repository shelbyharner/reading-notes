# The Coder's Computer Notes

What is a text editor? 
   A text editor is a web based or desktop based piece of software that allows you to write and manage text you put together to create a website. 

Features to look for in a text editor: 
 1. Code completion (allows you to start typing and this feature provides suggestions to auto complete, some include Emmet the shorthand language)
 2. Syntax highlighting (displays text in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms, makes it easier to find sections and errors)
 3. A good variety of themes. (reduces eye strain and fatigue - dark mode or rainbow text)
 4. A good variety of extensions to choose from if/when you need them. 

## Choosing a Text Editor

What are the different classifications of text editors, and why is it important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code?

Comparison of text editors: 
 - Basic text editor: Likely comes pre-installed on your computer, uses only plain text with no formatting. 
 - Coding-specific text editor: Software that you download onto your computer for more robust functions. Can depend on your operating system and what code language you are working with. (Visual Studio Code for this class. Others include Atom, NotePad++, Brackets, Sublime Text, etc.)
 - IDE (Integrated Development Environment): An IDE is one program for all functions. (Text editor, file manager, compiler and debugger)

 * Every computer comes with a built in text editor: Mac has Text Edit, Windows has Notepad
 
What is terminal? 
 
  - Terminal is the command line and text based communication to the system. (ex. macOS)
    - This is how we "talk" to the computer for it to complete commands or find things for us. 
  - Opening terminal on my mac: applications > utilities > terminal
  - Bash is an abbreviation for "Bourne again shell"
  - We can find out what shell we are using by using the "echo" command
  
Cheat-sheet/vocab: 

  - pwd = print working directory (where are we working currently)
  - ls = short for list (contents of directory)
  - Path = a file or directory on the command line (command to find a file or directory on the system)
  - Tilde (~) = home directory
  - Dot (.) = current directory
  - DotDot (..) = parent directory
  - cd = change directory (move to a different directory)
