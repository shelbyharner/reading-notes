# Revisions and the Cloud

**Best practice:** Always do small, frequent commits. Not large/many changes in one commit. Easier and faster to find/track/fix.  

## Commands to remember: 
 - Type: git status (shows what changed and status of change)
 - Type: code
 - Type: git add README.md (tells git what changes to move to the staging area to commit)
 - Type: git commit -m "your message goes here" (takes the snapshot/makes the commit)
   - The "-m" specifies the message to be included in the commit, git commit is the button to take snapshot
 - Type: git push origin main (syncs our changes to the code to our repo on GitHub)
 - Type: git remote -v (Tells you what remote git you are working on on your local machine)
 - Type: git fetch (Asks the repo if there are any changes/what is the current status)
 - Type: git pull (Tells terminal to pull in changes if there are any from the fetch)
