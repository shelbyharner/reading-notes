#Revisions and the Cloud

Best practice: Always do small, frequent commits. Not large/many changes in one commit. Easier and faster to find/track/fix.  

Commands to remember: 
 - "> git status" (shows change and status of change)
 - "> code"
 - "> git add README.md" (tells git what changes to move to the staging area to commit)
 - "> git commit -m "your message goes here" " (takes the snapshot/makes the commit)
   - The -m specifies the message to be included in the commit, git commit is the button to take snapshot
 - ">git push origin master" (syncs our changes to the code to our repo on GitHub)
 - "git remote -v" tells you what remote git you are working on on your local machine
 - "git fetch" asks the repo if there are any changes/what is the current status
 - "git pull" tells terminal to pull in changes if there are any from the fetch
