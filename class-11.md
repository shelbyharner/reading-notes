## Images
  - You can control the size of images in CSS the same way you can control the size of boxes, with height and width tags. 
    - Examples: 
      - Small portrait: 220px x 360px
      - Small landscape: 330px x 210px
      - Feature photo: 620px x 400px
  - You can "id" images in HTML to manipulate them individually or by grouping them with class names
  - Align images using the float or align-direction classes
  - The background-image property allows you to put a picture behind HTML content
  - Repeating images: background-repeat properties
    - repeat: background image is repeated horizontally and vertically
    - repeat-x: repeat horizontally
    - repeat-y: repeat vertically
    - no-repeat: image only shown once
    - fixed: background image stays fixed in one place
    - scroll: background image moves with the page as it's scrolled
  - Background-position: used when an image is not being repeated
  - Background property acts as shorthand for all other background properties
  - Create rollover effects by adjusting the background position of an image
  - Reduce the number of images a browser has to load by creating image sprites
