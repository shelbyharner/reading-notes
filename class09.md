# Functional Programming

  - Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that treats computation as the evaluation of math functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.
  - Pure functions return the same result if given the same arguments (dterministic) and does not cause any observable side effects.
  - Pure functions make the code easier to test.
  - Immutable code is code that the state cannot be changed after it is created.
  - Referential transparency is using pure functions and immutable data together.
  - Functions that are first-class entities are functions that are treated as values and used as data.
    - Refer to it from constants and variables.
    - Pass it as a parameter to other functions.
    - Return it as a result from other functions.
  - Higher order functions are those that take one or more functions as arguments or return a function as a result.

  - Refactoring is rewriting code to make it more efficient.
  - Good code is the combination of speed and readability/comprehension.
  - A hash function is used to map a given key to a location in a hash table.
