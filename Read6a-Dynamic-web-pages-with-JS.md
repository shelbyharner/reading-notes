# Read6a Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript Notes

JavaScript is a programming language used in web development that add dynamic and interactive elements to a website. 
    - JavaScript is code that tells a website when X happens, run Y code

## HTML/CSS/JavaScript works together by:
    - HTML is the content layer, the skeleton
        * The HTML layer is the focus on the most important elements of site content
    - CSS is the presentation layer, the skin
        * Add the CSS to a separate file to keep the rules of the HTML intact
    - JavaScript is the behavior layer, the muscles
        * Add JS last  to enhance usability and the user experience
