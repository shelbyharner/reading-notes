    * How do you store or represent information using electricity?
        - Single wire with electricity flowing through it giving a yes/no, on/off answer is a bit. 
        - Any number can be represented in the bianary number system using just 1s and 0s.
        - Letters are represented by numbering the alphabet. (A is 1, B is 2, C is 3, etc.)
        - Graphics are broken down into pixels. Pixels have colors,  which are assigned a color in numerical format.
        - Sounds are represented graphically in a wave form, which the axis are assigned numerical value that then correspond to the waves of the sound wavelength.

    * Cicuits and Logic
        - One number is represented by one elecrtical signal.
        - Circuits can do information flipping (not), can take in multiple inputs and combine them (and), and many other logical calculations. (Addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.)
        - Circuits today are microscopic. Smaller computers are faster because the electricity signals have shorter lengths to travel. 

    * CPU, Memory, Input & Output
        - Input: converts physical input into binary information
        - Memory: stores information on a computer
        - CPU: Stands for Central Processing Unit and it calculates information
        - Output: converts information into the physical output
        -The more complicated an input task is, the more memory and processing power (CPUs) a computer needs.
