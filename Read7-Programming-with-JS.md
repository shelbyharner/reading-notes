# Read7 Programming with JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language used to add dynamic and interactive elements to webpages. 

A script is a series of instructions that the computer follows to achieve a goal. They can include: 
    - Simple scripts that deal with one scenario like a recipe or step by step for one outcome.
    - A multiple scenario script which can lead to different outcomes based on situations.
    - Or a step by step test check. One test must be passed before moving on to the next step.

## Writing a script:
    1 - Define the goal (define the task you want to have completed)
    1 - Design the script (split the goal into a series of tasks, can use a flowchart or a step by step)
    1 - Code each step (break down the steps in a coding language - JS- that the computer can understand)

    - Expression: An expression results in a single value. Can be a color indication or a simple equation.
        * var color = 'red'
        * var area = 3 + 2
    - Expressions rely on operators. This is the ability to create a single value from multiple variables.
        * Operators are: + for addition, - for subtraction, / for division, * for multiplication, etc.
        * var message = greeting + name +!
