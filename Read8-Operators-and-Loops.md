# Read8 Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators - Evaluating Conditions
  - == is equal to: compares two values to see if they are the same
  - === is strict equal to: compares two value types to make sure the data type and value are the same
  - != is not equal to: compares two values to make sure they are NOT the same
  - !== is strict not equal to: compares two value types to make sure the data type and value are NOT the same
  - ">" greater than: number on the left of symbol is greater than the other
  - "<" less than: number on the left of the symbol is less than the other
  - ">=" greater than or equal to
  - "<=" less than or equal to

## Logical Operators
Comparison operators usually compare single values of true/false (boolean), but logical operators compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
  - && is logical and: operator tests more than one condition
  - || is logical or: operator tests at least one condition
  - ! is logical not: operator takes a single boolean value and inverts it
