*Duckett HTML Book*

## Elements
  - block level elements: h1, p, ul, li
  - inline elements: img, b, i

## Positioning
  - normal flow: every block level element appears on it's own new line (paragraphs one after the other, vertically on the page)
  - relative positioning: moves an element from it's normal flow to the top, bottom, left or right (does not affect the surrounding elements)
  - absolute positioning: positions the element in relation to it's containing element
  - fixed positioning: a form of absolute positioning that positions an element in relation to the browser window instead of in relation to it's containing element
  - floating elements: allows you to take an element out of normal flow and position it to the right or left of a containing box

  - position: static - normal flow of HTML elements, no CSS property indication needed
  - position: relative - positioning relative to where an element normally would have been 
  - position: absolute - box taken out of flow and does not affect the position of other elements on the page
  - position: fixed - positions an element in relation to the browser window ex.fixed nav bar at the top

  - z-index: stacking content, similar to bring to front or send to back
  - float: allows you to place an element out of its regular flow and make it left or right
  - clear: says that no element within the same container can touch the left or right of a box

  - fixed width layout: design that does not change size with the page
  - liquid layout: design stretches or shrinks to fit size of the page
